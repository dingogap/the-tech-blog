24. homeRoutes getting confusing - implement dashboardRoutes separate routes
25. Express Handlebars lacks flexibility of Liquid & combined with specificity of routes means listing, adding and editing on a single page is not worth the trouble & the code is horrible. Need Add/Edit routes.
26. Coded /dashboard/add & dashboard/edit - looks promising
27. Date Issues? Removed Date field & tried default dates. Might be all that is needed. Reverted to original date field. 
27. Add Post & Edit Post code working
28. Remove toTitleCase - not appropriate for Post Titles
29. Should have started with clean code rather than using my Project2 routes code to start.
30. Should have used Materialize Cards rather than building custom code - worth revisiting?
31. Date issue with custom date - stopped using dayjs & used the helper format_date in utils
32. Delete Post Code Working.
33. Since starting this my computer has been freezing/rebooting every few hours - very frustrating. It started after I installed nodemon (may be coincidence). Uninstalled nodemon to see if fault continues.

35. Added get Post Routes to show Post & wait for Comment
36. Continual computer crashes is making it almost impossible to continue - I don't need to submit this anyway. Deleted github repository.

38. Checking & uploading to GitHub - routes look OK in Insomnia
39. Final files copied into app aftre yet another system crash!!
